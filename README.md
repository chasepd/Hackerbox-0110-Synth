# Hackerbox-0110-Synth
Code from working on [Hackerbox #0110, Synth](https://hackerboxes.com/collections/past-hackerboxes/products/hackerbox-0110-synth).

I converted the synthesizer from the project into a simple game where you attempt to keep the ball inside the circular screen for as long as possible. Unfortunately, the screen died on me before I was able to get a photo/video of the game running.
